\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{end}

This set of deliverables represents the outcome of more than half a year worth of team meetings, discussions, group work and overlaps with many external obligations, being them other courses/exams or just personal matters.

The required progress was student-driven in its entirety, and represented a valuable lesson in terms of both hard and soft-skills. Of course, the implementation followed a very deep reasoning phase in which all the theoretical knowledge previously available to the authors was exploited and expanded on, in order to make a considerable amount of arbitrary design choices. On the other hand, team effort was crucial during the whole duration of this projectâ€”code sharing, calendar planning, hand picking features and discussing many different solutions to the same problem, \emph{all} represented a series of obstacles that had to be overcome in order to eventually shape an acceptable product.

Finally, the fact of trying to make everything as easy to use as possible required an increased effort into extensively commenting the code itself and writing it in a clear and concise way. All this would in turn require the authors to unequivocally grasp every single detail of their own implementation, therefore mastering the whole architecture and eventually being able to present it in first person.
