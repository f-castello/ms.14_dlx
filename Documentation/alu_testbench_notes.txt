ALU TESTBENCH 

The CARRY is set if:
- the addition of two numbers causes a carry out of the most significant bits added
- if the subtraction of two numbers requires a borrow into the most significant bits subtracted
TEST 1 : 
	- UNSIGNED ADDITION 
	 1. O = 0, C = 0, Z = 0, N = 0  00000003 + 00000002 = 00000005
	 2. O = 1, C = 1, Z = 1, N = 0  FFFFFFFF + 00000001 = 00000000

TEST 2 : 
	- SIGNED ADDITION 
	 1. O = 1 , N = 1 , C = 0, Z = 0  7FFFFFFF + 00000001 = 80000000, two positive operands and negative result
	 2. O = 1 , N = 0 , C = 1, Z = 0  FFFFFFFF + 80000000 = 7FFFFFFF, two negative operands and positive result
	 3. O = 0 , N = 0 , C = 0, Z = 0  10000011 + 00000010 = 10000021

TEST 3 :
	- I_beqz 
	 1. O = 0 , N = 0 , C = 0, Z = 0   00000FF1 + 00000000 = 00000FF1
	 2. O = 0 , N = 0 , C = 0, Z = 1   FFFFFFFF + 80000000 = 00000000, two negative operands and positive result 

	-I_bnez
	 1. O = 0 , N = 0 , C = 0, Z = 0     00000FF1 + 00000FF2 = 00001FE3
	 2. O = 0 , N = 0 , C = 1, Z = 0     FFFFFFFF + 10000000 = 0FFFFFFF
	 3. O = 0 , N = 0 , C = 0, Z = 1   	 00000FF1 + 00000000 = 00000000

TEST 4 :
	- UNSIGNED SUBTRACTION 
	 1. O = 0 , N = 0 , C = 0, Z = 0     00000FF2 - 00000010 = 00000FE2
	 2. O = 0 , N = 0 , C = 0, Z = 1     FFFFFFFF - FFFFFFFF = 00000000

TEST 5 :
	- SIGNED SUBTRACTION 
	  The carry(borrow) flag is also set if the subtraction of two numbers requires a borrow int the most significant bit  subtracted
	 1. O = 0 ,N = 0 , C = 1, Z = 0    70000000 - 80000000 = EFFFFFFE
	 2. O = 1, N = 0 , C = 0, Z = 0     FFFFFFFF - FFFFFFFF = 00000000
	 3. O = 0, N = 0 , C = 0, Z = 0     FFFFFFDD - FFFFFFDB = 00000020

TEST 6 : 
	- LOGIC OPERATIONS 
	 1. ***AND*** 00000FF1 & 00000FF2 = 00000FF0
	 2. ***OR**** 00000FF1 | 00000FF2 = 00000FF3
	 3. ***XOR*** 00000FF1 ^ 00000FF2 = 00000003

TEST 7 : 
 	- SHIFTS
 	 1. 00000FF1 << 16 = FF10000
 	 2. 00000FF1 << 25 (last five bits of 00000FF9) = E2000000
 	 3. 00000FF1 >> 1  (last five bits of 00000001) = 000007F8
 	 4. 00000FF1 >> 2 (arithmetic)                  = 000003FC

TEST 8 : 
	- COMPARISONS
	 1. EQUAL 
	 2. DIFFERENT
	 3. LOWER THAN SIGNED FFFFFFFF < 00000001  -> 1
	 4. GREATER THAN SIGNED 00000001 > FFFFFFFF -> 1
	 5. LOWER AND EQUAL than signed 00000001 <= FFFFFFFF -> 0
	 6. GREATER AND EQUAL than signed FFFFFFFF >= 00000001 -> 0
	 7. LOWER THAN unsigned 00000001 < 7FFFFFFF -> 1
	 8. GREATER THAN unsigned 7FFFFFFF > 00000001 -> 1
	 9. LOWER AND EQUAL THAN unsigned 7FFFFFFF <= 00000001 -> 0
	 10. GREATER AND EQUAL THAN unsigned 00000001 >= 7FFFFFFF -> 0

TEST 9 :
	- SIGNED MULTIPLICATION -> WORST CASE 16+16 = 32
	00000002 * 00000011     = 00000022 
	FFFF(FFFF) * FFFF(FFFF) = 00000001 

TEST 10 : 
	- UNSIGNED MULTIPLICATION -> WORST CASE 16+16 = 32
	1. F000(2211) * 0000(0003) = 00006633
	2. FFFF(FFFF) * 0000(0003) = 0002FFFD
	3. FFFF(FFFF) * FFFF(FFFF) = FFFE0001
